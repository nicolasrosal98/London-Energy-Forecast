# London Energy Forecast

Using an LSTM model to forecast energy consumption in London (analysis by Acorns included).

## Datasets

The datasets required can be found in the following [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london)

<br /><br />


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a deep learning model capable of recognising trends in energy consumption and generating forecasts of future usage levels. All this, to help:

* Energy Companies understand user consumption trends and better generate consumption estimates in the future.
* Users by providing information about their future energy consumption levels (one month ahead). 
* The local government better understand the overall energy consumption patterns and future behaviour in London. 
* Any interested party by providing a framework that allows them to further explore how acorns, contract type, seasons, etc. (other features) can be useful at generating more accurate forecasting models.

## Methodology

### 1. Cleaning

The goal of this section was to clean and combine all available datasets into a single dataset that would be easier to handle for exploratory data analysis. Moreover, during the process, the following features were engineered to further explore energy consumption:
